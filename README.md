# JSON-parser
A little JSON parser written in C that isnt finished yet. 

# No makefile yet because im too lazy, Just compile main.c and it should work
Once compiled, Run as follows:
  ```./main.c file.json Key```
 * `File.json` is the JSON file you wish to parse
 * `Key` is the key of the value you wish to print.
